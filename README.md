**Lossless context memory for [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent).**

> Bounded context, unbounded memory. Nothing is ever lost.

LCM-X replaces one-shot active-context compression with a SQLite-backed,
DAG-based context engine. It keeps the live prompt bounded, preserves raw
messages, and gives the agent tools to recover exact detail after compaction.

The project name is **LCM-X**. From v0.24.0 the plugin is named
`hermes-lcm-x` and the runtime context engine `lcm-x`
([#471](https://github.com/electricsheephq/lcm-x/issues/471)); this is a
**breaking change** for existing installs — see
[Migrating from hermes-lcm](#migrating-from-hermes-lcm-v023x-and-earlier).
Unchanged: `lcm.db`, the `lcm:` config block, `LCM_*` environment variables,
the `lcm_*` tools, `/lcm`, and the bundled skill name `hermes-lcm`.

Based on the [LCM paper](https://papers.voltropy.com/LCM) by Ehrlich & Blackman
(Voltropy PBC, Feb 2026). Inspired by
[lossless-claw](https://github.com/martian-engineering/lossless-claw) for
OpenClaw. For an interactive visualization of the LCM idea, see

## What it does

Hermes Agent's built-in compressor is a practical continuity layer: when the
prompt crosses its configured threshold, it prunes older tool results, asks an
auxiliary model to summarize the middle/older conversation, and rebuilds the
active prompt from that summary plus a protected recent tail. The original
session rows can still live in Hermes `state.db` and remain searchable through
host tools such as `session_search`, but the model's active context no longer
contains the compacted turns verbatim or a structured drill-down path back to
them.

LCM-X instead:

1. **Persists messages** in a plugin-local SQLite store with FTS metadata.
2. **Compacts older context** into depth-aware summary nodes.
3. **Condenses summaries** into a hierarchical DAG as they accumulate.
4. **Assembles active context** from system prompt, highest-value summaries, and
   the protected fresh tail.
5. **Provides recall tools** so agents can search, inspect, and expand compacted
   material without flooding the main prompt.

Nothing is lost in normal operation. Raw messages stay recoverable in bounded
pages, summaries retain source lineage, and oversized externalized payloads keep
stable refs for later expansion.

</p>

Core capabilities:

- **SQLite message store** - preserves raw messages before compaction
- **Summary DAG** - builds depth-aware summary nodes over compacted history
- **Bounded recovery** - pages raw messages, child summaries, and externalized
  payloads instead of dumping everything into the prompt
- **Agent tools** - `lcm_grep`, `lcm_recall`, `lcm_query_state`, `lcm_compute`, `lcm_compile_evidence`, `lcm_evidence_pack`, `lcm_retrieve`, `lcm_recent`, `lcm_load_session`,
  `lcm_describe`, `lcm_expand`, `lcm_expand_query`, `lcm_status`, `lcm_inspect`,
  and `lcm_doctor`
- **Source-aware retrieval** - filters raw rows and summaries by descendant
  source lineage
- **Session controls** - ignore noisy sessions or keep sessions read-only with
  glob patterns
- **Large payload controls** - externalize oversized tool/media/raw payloads and
  protect SQLite from inline media-ish base64 blobs
- **Sensitive-pattern controls** - two independent layers: opt-in durable redaction of API
  keys, bearer tokens, passwords, and private keys before LCM stores or summarizes them
  (off by default — the durable store is lossless), and automatic protection of the copies
  sent to known cloud embedding providers
- **Diagnostics** - runtime health, database checks, optional `/lcm` slash
  commands, backup-first repair/rotate paths

Beyond the core loop, three opt-in (default-off) feature families extend LCM
from a compression layer into a memory system: **large-output externalization
and context-budget controls** (giant tool results move to recoverable refs
instead of crowding the prompt), **temporal memory** (day/week/month rollups
plus natural-time recall through `lcm_recent`), and **semantic retrieval**
(embedding-backed `lcm_grep` semantic/hybrid modes with Voyage,
OpenAI-compatible endpoints, Ollama, or in-process FastEmbed). See the
[Feature overview](docs/features-overview.md) for what each family does and
why, and [Agent configuration profiles](docs/agent-config-profiles.md) for
copy-paste setups per agent type.

## Project status

The latest stable release is
`v0.24.8@7ed790c84b493395bdc1c929c1ee4d7ea0eaaceb` (plugin `hermes-lcm-x`, engine
`lcm-x`; the rename shipped in v0.24.0, #471). It carries
the v0.23.2 lossless
default (durable sensitive-pattern redaction is opt-in; cloud-embedding privacy
is an independent flag that transforms only the provider-bound copy — see
"Sensitive-pattern redaction" below), the PEM private-key redaction hardening,
loud privacy-policy failures on the recall path, and the rc-first release
gauntlet, while preserving the 15-tool surface, schema-5 core store, and
default-off experimental features.

Stable release identity and the continuing `main` development line are
separate proof planes; do not describe an arbitrary `main` checkout as the
installed stable product.

The `main` line now identifies itself as
`hermes-lcm-x v0.24.9 (15 tools)` — drain: one foreground time budget, stub-first exit, exit fit,
scan allowance — on top of the
`v0.24.8` release tag, which identifies itself as `hermes-lcm-x v0.24.8 (15 tools)`.
This is the forward bump for the next patch release, never a restamp
of any past commit's own recorded identity (#385 fixed the earlier drift).

Eva has accepted exact stable v0.23.1 with hosted `voyage-4-large`,
1024-dimensional float32 summary vectors under one privacy-bound identity.
That evidence establishes runtime safety for Eva only, not fleet, customer,
Teams, answer-accuracy, or universal benchmark readiness.

The active finite evaluation is [#341](https://github.com/electricsheephq/lcm-x/issues/341):
an answer-blind, exact-stable LongMemEval retrieval-provenance audit. It keeps
product and benchmark-instrument identities separate and cannot change product
retrieval behavior. See [Current project state](docs/project-status.md), the
[roadmap](ROADMAP.md), and [Benchmark methodology](benchmarks/METHODOLOGY.md)
for current identities, gaps, and proof boundaries.

## LCM vs built-in compression

Hermes core may persist original conversation history in `state.db` before
built-in compression rewrites the active prompt. Built-in compression can still
be lossy in the active context, but previous content may be recoverable later
through host-level history tools such as `session_search`.

LCM-X is different because recall is part of the active context engine:

- plugin-local store and DAG built specifically for drill-down
- current-session retrieval through LCM tools, not an auxiliary cross-session
  search step
- explicit source-lineage and session-boundary rules

Position LCM around retrieval quality, autonomy, and drill-down behavior. Do not
claim that Hermes core has no persisted record of pre-compression history.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Hermes Agent
- Python 3.11+
- No required third-party runtime dependencies

`tiktoken` is used if available; otherwise LCM falls back to character-based
token estimates. `regex` is used if available to apply timeouts to message ignore
patterns; without it, message-level regex filtering is disabled with a warning
rather than running unbounded stdlib `re` matches.

### Install the plugin

Canonical install path: clone LCM-X as a general user plugin into
`plugins/hermes-lcm-x`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/electricsheephq/lcm-x \
  ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-lcm-x
```

For a profile-specific install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/electricsheephq/lcm-x \
  ~/.hermes/profiles/myprofile/plugins/hermes-lcm-x
```

From an existing checkout, install a symlink:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh

# Optional profile-aware install:
HERMES_PROFILE=myprofile ./scripts/install.sh
```

On Windows, use PowerShell 7.2 or newer (`pwsh`) and `scripts\install.ps1`. Hermes' home
there is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes` unless `HERMES_HOME` is set:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/electricsheephq/lcm-x "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\hermes\plugins\hermes-lcm-x"

# Or, from an existing checkout:
.\scripts\install.ps1

# Optional profile-aware install:
.\scripts\install.ps1 -HermesProfile myprofile
```

`install.ps1` does what `install.sh` does: the same preflight, the same refusals and
migration output, and it never edits `config.yaml` or deletes anything. It creates
symbolic links, and falls back to directory junctions when symbolic links are not
permitted (turn on Windows Developer Mode to allow them); Hermes follows both. It
also accepts `-HermesHome <full path>` and `-LinkType Auto|SymbolicLink|Junction`.
`HERMES_HOME` may use `~`, `$VAR`, `${VAR}` or `%VAR%` as Hermes does, but a relative or
half-expanded path is refused, and a profile must be a valid Hermes profile name
(lowercase letters, digits, `_` and `-`).

Run `scripts/install.sh` (or `scripts\install.ps1`) even when the checkout already lives at the canonical
plugin path. It leaves that checkout in place and exposes the bundled
`hermes-lcm` skill in the matching global/profile `skills/` directory. The
installer preflights both paths and refuses conflicts before creating links.
When it finds a pre-0.24 install (`plugins/hermes-lcm`, or a `config.yaml` that
enables `hermes-lcm` / selects `context.engine: lcm`), it prints the migration
steps below. It never edits `config.yaml` and never deletes the old directory.

Semantic retrieval is optional; its dependency and recovery after a host update are described in the [embedding setup doc](docs/embeddings-setup.md#a-host-update-can-remove-fastembed).

### Activate it

The plugin has two names:

- plugin manifest name: `hermes-lcm-x`
- runtime context engine name: `lcm-x`

Both must be configured:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled:
    - hermes-lcm-x

context:
  engine: lcm-x
```

Restart Hermes after changing plugin or context-engine config.

### Verify it loaded

Run:

```bash
hermes plugins list
```

Expected signals:

- plugin list includes `hermes-lcm-x`
- selected context engine is `lcm-x`
- tool list includes `lcm_grep`, `lcm_recall`, `lcm_recent`,
  `lcm_load_session`, `lcm_describe`, `lcm_expand`, `lcm_expand_query`,
  `lcm_status`, `lcm_inspect`, and `lcm_doctor`
- the normal available-skills index includes `hermes-lcm`; current hosts can
  also resolve the explicit plugin-qualified skill `hermes-lcm-x:hermes-lcm`

On the `main` line, typical output is:

```text
Plugins (1):
  ✓ hermes-lcm-x v0.24.9 (15 tools)

Provider Plugins:
  Context Engine: lcm-x
```

Older `v0.23.x` stable tags instead report `hermes-lcm v0.23.x (15 tools)`
and engine `lcm`; verify the loaded commit before treating either string as
release proof.

For source checkouts, `lcm_status`, `/lcm status`, `lcm_inspect`,
`lcm_doctor`, and `/lcm doctor` also report the loaded plugin path and
best-effort git identity:
`plugin_git_commit`, `plugin_git_branch`, and `plugin_git_dirty`.

If startup logs say LCM tools are available through `context-engine schemas` or
mention the `Path B fallback`, that is expected on older Hermes hosts such as
Hermes Agent v0.16. All 15 `lcm_*` tools remain available through the
context-engine path; standalone plugin-registry registration is not required
there.

### Update it

If you cloned directly into the plugin directory:

```bash
cd ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-lcm-x && git pull --ff-only
```

For a profile-specific install:

```bash
cd ~/.hermes/profiles/myprofile/plugins/hermes-lcm-x && git pull --ff-only
```

A clone from v0.23.x or earlier still lives at `plugins/hermes-lcm`. Stop
Hermes, update that clone in place (Hermes matches the manifest name, not the
directory), then make the config change in
[Migrating from hermes-lcm](#migrating-from-hermes-lcm-v023x-and-earlier)
before you start Hermes again:

```bash
cd ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-lcm && git pull --ff-only
# profile-specific:
cd ~/.hermes/profiles/myprofile/plugins/hermes-lcm && git pull --ff-only
```

If you installed a symlink from a separate checkout, update that checkout and
rerun the installer (it is idempotent):

```bash
git -C /path/to/lcm-x pull --ff-only && /path/to/lcm-x/scripts/install.sh
```

A catalog install (`hermes plugins install hermes-lcm-x`) updates only through
the reviewed catalog pin: `hermes plugins update hermes-lcm-x`. LCM-X ships no
self-updater. An install pinned with `--ref <sha>` (outside the catalog) refuses
`hermes plugins update`; move it to the new reviewed commit with
`hermes plugins install https://github.com/electricsheephq/lcm-x --force --ref <40-character commit SHA>`
(the refusal prints that command).

Restart Hermes after updating.

Before upgrading to v0.23.1, resolve the effective database path from
`LCM_DATABASE_PATH` or `lcm_status`. For an online backup, set
`LCM_ENABLE_SLASH_COMMAND=true` in the old runtime's launch environment,
restart that runtime so `/lcm` is registered, then run `/lcm backup`.
Otherwise stop every SQLite writer and copy that configured database with its
WAL/SHM companions as one cold set. Check out the exact stable tag/SHA, restart
Hermes, and verify the loaded path, version, database path, schema 5, and all 15
tools. No manual core migration is required for the upgrade itself. Existing
cloud vectors from a pre-v0.23.1 identity require privacy-policy warmup, an
identity check from the warmup/profile output, and the finite monotonic
dry-run/apply loop in the operator guide before semantic coverage is complete.

Cloud embeddings are a separate opt-in. Provider-bound copies use the configured
sensitive-pattern catalog by default, while durable messages and FTS remain raw.
`LCM_EMBEDDING_PRIVACY_ENABLED=false` explicitly opts out and binds vectors to
the distinguished `privacy:off` revision. When provider-copy privacy is on, the
catalog must be nonempty and contain only supported pattern names (any unknown
name fails warmup and dispatch loudly). Dry-run the backfill first;
raw-chunk cloud backfill also requires explicit raw-text consent.
See [the operator upgrade and privacy notes](docs/operator-guide.md#upgrade-to-v0231)
before enabling embeddings.


### Migrating from hermes-lcm (v0.23.x and earlier)

**BREAKING in v0.24.0.** The plugin manifest is now `hermes-lcm-x` and the
context engine `lcm-x` (#471). Hermes matches `plugins.enabled` against the
manifest name, not the install directory, so a config that enables only
`hermes-lcm` stops loading LCM-X after an update. Run exactly one LCM copy, and
change the config while Hermes is stopped:

1. **Stop Hermes** (every process that uses this profile).
2. **Update the code:** `git pull --ff-only` in the existing clone (it may stay
   at `plugins/hermes-lcm`; see [Update it](#update-it)), or install a new
   checkout with `scripts/install.sh`.
3. **Config:** in `plugins.enabled`, replace `hermes-lcm` with `hermes-lcm-x`,
   and set `context.engine: lcm-x`:

   ```yaml
   plugins:
     enabled:
       - hermes-lcm-x
   context:
     engine: lcm-x
   ```

   - If a separate older copy is still installed (for example v0.23.x left at
     `plugins/hermes-lcm` next to a new `plugins/hermes-lcm-x`), do **not** keep
     both names enabled: both copies would load. LCM-X detects that state, logs
     `Another LCM generation is already loaded`, and stays inert so only one
     copy writes `lcm.db`, but LCM-X itself is then not running.
   - Keeping `hermes-lcm` listed next to `hermes-lcm-x` is harmless only when
     `plugins/hermes-lcm` is this same checkout (an in-place clone, or the
     link `scripts/install.sh` reuses): there is one physical copy.
   - The legacy `context.engine: lcm` still selects LCM-X through an alias, but
     logs a once-per-process `DEPRECATED LCM-X config` warning and reports an
     `identity_migration` field in `lcm_status` and a `warn` check in
     `lcm_doctor` naming the exact change.
4. **Start Hermes and verify:** `hermes plugins list` shows `hermes-lcm-x` as
   enabled and `hermes-lcm` as not enabled (an old directory kept for rollback
   may still be listed), and the log shows
   `LCM plugin loaded — lossless context management active`.
5. **Later, by hand:** after verifying, remove a separate old directory (and
   its `skills/hermes-lcm` link). Keep it until then for rollback (a rollback
   also needs the steps in the
   [operator guide](docs/operator-guide.md#rollback)). The installer never
   edits `config.yaml` or deletes anything.

**If the config is not updated:** Hermes logs
`Context engine 'lcm' not found — falling back to built-in compressor` and runs
without LCM-X. The existing `lcm.db` is untouched, but turns handled while
Hermes runs without LCM-X (built-in compressor) are not in `lcm.db` and their
compacted content may not be recoverable. Therefore update the config before
restarting Hermes after the update.

**Managed fleets** (PCS / managed-plugin payloads) stay pinned to v0.23.x until
their config stages `hermes-lcm-x` in `plugins.enabled`. That staging is a
separate fleet-migration change owned outside this repository.

### Hermes plugin catalog and install-scanner notes

The catalog build follows the plugin-catalog admission rules: no self-updater
(`scripts/update.sh` was removed; catalog installs update only through
`hermes plugins update hermes-lcm-x`), `provides_hooks` matches what
`register()` registers (`pre_llm_call`, `post_llm_call`, `subagent_start`,
`subagent_stop`, all through `ctx.register_hook`), and `hermes plugins validate`
reports the install scanner verdict `safe`: zero `dangerous` and zero `caution`
(high-severity) findings. Planted-secret fixtures build their PEM markers by
string concatenation and the bench env captures avoid piping the `env` listing, so test
data is not read as a real key or an environment dump.

The scanner still lists informational (medium/low) findings; none affects the
verdict:

- `embedded_private_key`, `hardcoded_secret`, `openai_key_leaked` — planted,
  non-functional fixtures in `tests/` that prove redaction and privacy controls.
- `python_subprocess`, `hex_encoded_string`, `uv_run`, `path_traversal` —
  benchmark and release-gauntlet harnesses under `bench/` and `benchmarks/`
  that drive local Hermes runs; not loaded by the plugin.
- `git_clone`, `unpinned_pip_install`, `dump_all_env` — install/contributor
  docs and CI (`pip install pytest numpy`), plus one doc describing an env
  dump; documentation only.
- `eval_string`, `proc_access`, `system_passwd_access` — test assertions that
  such strings are rejected or handled.
- `oversized_file`, `oversized_bundle`, `too_many_files` — the repository
  ships docs images, large test modules, and benchmark tooling with the plugin.
- `agent_config_ref`, `hermes_config_ref`, `hardcoded_ip_port` (low) —
  maintainer skills and config examples that reference `AGENTS.md`,
  `config.yaml`, or loopback endpoints.

`hermes plugins validate` also warns that the 15 `provides_tools` are not
registered by `register()`: LCM-X serves its tools through the context-engine
tool schemas (`ContextEngine.get_tool_schemas`), which is the intended path.

## Commands and tools

### Agent tools

Use these tools for current-session recall after compaction. Use Hermes
`session_search` for earlier separate sessions or broad cross-session history
outside the LCM database.

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| `lcm_grep` | Search current-session raw messages and summaries. Opt into `content_scope='externalized'|'both'` for bounded active-session payload search, or `session_scope='all'|'session'` for bounded raw-message archive recovery; broader scopes return raw-message hits only. |
| `lcm_recall` | Search the entire memory across ALL conversations and all time by meaning. Fuses full-text, summary-vector, and chunk-vector arms with RRF, then applies a soft current-conversation (`scope_bias`) and recency prior. Returns bounded summary and verbatim-excerpt hits with `lcm_expand` handles; works FTS-only when embeddings are disabled. |
| `lcm_query_state` | Query the opt-in V4 assertion sidecar for bounded current or historical facts, preferences, recommendations, commitments, actions, and status. Every result carries an exact message ref/span/quote; conflicts stay visible. |
| `lcm_compute` | Execute supported dates, distinct counts, compatible-unit sums, directed/absolute differences, ordering, and latest-state operations over exact cited evidence. Planning, arithmetic, and trace verification are dependency-free and provider-neutral; ambiguous or incomplete inputs fail closed. |
| `lcm_compile_evidence` | Validate one bounded provider-neutral semantic proposal against exact stored refs and return a compact evidence brief with explicit sufficiency state and an optional canonical computation. It never returns final prose or treats model claims as finite-coverage proof. |
| `lcm_evidence_pack` | Hydrate and validate bounded baseline exact refs in the same `lcm.db`, repair only unique in-window quote spans, preserve occurrence/observation time separation, and optionally emit an immutable canonical computation trace without prose. |
| `lcm_retrieve` | Opt-in bounded controller for one continuous answerer tool turn. It tracks typed evidence slots, permits at most three targeted calls to existing retrieval tools, accepts only exact observed refs, caps the evidence context, and can finish through `lcm_compute`. It persists evidence views and traces, never final prose. |
| `lcm_recent` | Retrieve recent summaries by natural UTC period, preferring ready rollups and transparently falling back to time-bounded leaf summaries. |
| `lcm_load_session` | Load one ordered raw-message transcript page for an explicit `session_id`. Continues with `after_store_id` from `next_cursor`; opt into exact slice refs with `include_exact_ref=true`. |
| `lcm_describe` | Inspect the current-session DAG or preview an `externalized_ref` without loading full content. |
| `lcm_expand` | Recover source messages, child summaries, or externalized payloads with pagination. Use `store_id` to fetch a single raw message from a cross-session `lcm_grep` result and `include_exact_ref=true` when its returned slice must be cited or computed. |
| `lcm_expand_query` | Answer a question using expanded current-session LCM context while returning a bounded answer. |
| `lcm_status` | Show runtime health, context pressure, config, source lineage, and lifecycle stats. |
| `lcm_inspect` | Read-only operator inventory for current-session lineage, frontier/fresh-tail metadata, externalized refs/readability, compaction skip/no-op reasons, and matched ignore/stateless patterns. Returns metadata only; use retrieval tools for content. |
| `lcm_doctor` | Run database, FTS, lifecycle, config, and context-pressure diagnostics. |

## Recall skill and policy

LCM-X ships `skills/hermes-lcm/SKILL.md` plus progressive-disclosure
references for configuration, architecture, diagnostics, recall routing, and
session lifecycle. The installer links that directory into the active Hermes
profile so it appears in ordinary skill discovery. On hosts with plugin skill
registration, it is also available explicitly as `hermes-lcm-x:hermes-lcm`.

The canonical policy is distributed through that bundled skill. It is not
injected through `pre_llm_call`: current Hermes persists hook context in the
current user's `api_content` and replays it as user-authored history. Keeping
policy out of that seam prevents attribution errors and one-copy-per-user-turn
replay growth while preserving clean transcript and LCM ingest. The policy:

- treats summaries as recall cues rather than exact proof;
- prefers newer source-backed evidence and verifies contradictions;
- teaches narrow FTS query construction and bounded scope selection;
- routes current compacted, cross-conversation, and recent/time-bounded recall
  through the appropriate existing tools;
- does not force a tool call when the current context is already sufficient.

The canonical bytes live in
`skills/hermes-lcm/references/recall-policy.md`. The active-LCM
`pre_llm_call` hook remains available for bounded pre-answer evidence when that
feature is explicitly enabled, but it never prepends the recall policy. Older
hosts without skill or hook registration keep their existing schema-driven
behavior.

### Slash commands

Slash commands are disabled by default. Enable them only in trusted operator
contexts:

```bash
export LCM_ENABLE_SLASH_COMMAND=1
```

Available commands:

- `/lcm` or `/lcm status` - current runtime/session status
- `/lcm doctor` - read-only health checks
- `/lcm doctor clean` - read-only scan for obvious junk/noise session candidates
- `/lcm doctor clean apply` - backup-first cleanup for safe pattern-matched
  candidates; requires `LCM_DOCTOR_CLEAN_APPLY_ENABLED=true`
- `/lcm doctor repair` - read-only SQLite/FTS repair diagnostics
- `/lcm doctor repair apply` - backup-first SQLite/FTS repair
- `/lcm doctor source` - read-only scan for legacy blank-source rows
- `/lcm doctor source apply` - backup-first normalization of legacy blank-source
  rows to `unknown`
- `/lcm doctor retention` - read-only retention analysis
- `/lcm backup` - timestamped SQLite backup
- `/lcm rotate` - read-only preview of an in-place tail-preserving compact of
  the active session
- `/lcm rotate apply` - backup-first rotate that advances the lifecycle frontier
  past pre-tail raw messages
- `/lcm help` - command help

Apply paths are intentionally narrow and backup-first. Start with diagnostics
before cleanup or repair.

### Rotate: compact in place without changing session identity

`/lcm rotate` compacts a long-running session in place without changing
`session_id` or `conversation_id`. It is the in-session counterpart to
Hermes-level `/new` and to `/lcm doctor clean`.

What rotate does:

- preserves the live tail (`LCM_FRESH_TAIL_COUNT` most-recent messages)
- advances the lifecycle frontier marker past every raw message before the tail,
  so subsequent bootstrap stops replaying them into the active prompt
- writes a rolling `*-rotate-latest.sqlite3` backup under the same backup
  directory as `/lcm backup`, overwriting the previous rotate slot atomically so
  disk usage stays bounded across repeated rotates

What rotate does not do:

- it does not delete raw messages; pre-tail rows remain recoverable through
  `lcm_load_session` and `lcm_expand`
- it does not invoke the summarization model; trigger normal compaction first if
  you want pre-tail content covered by summary nodes before rotating
- it does not change session or conversation identity, and it refuses ignored or
  stateless sessions with a clear reason

`lcm_status` and `/lcm status` surface `last_rotate_at` and the rolling backup
path. Re-running `/lcm rotate apply` after the frontier is already at or ahead of
the target boundary reports `status: noop` and does not overwrite the previous
known-good rolling backup.

## Configuration

Most installs only need `plugins.enabled` and `context.engine: lcm-x`.

### Common settings

| Variable | Default | Use |
|----------|---------|-----|
| `LCM_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD` | `0.35` | Fraction of the context window that triggers LCM compaction |
| `LCM_ABSOLUTE_THRESHOLD_TOKENS` | `0` | If `> 0`, force compaction at this absolute prompt-token count instead of `context_length × LCM_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD`. Cross-model context-health setpoint (common coding default: `130000`) so large windows do not delay compaction and degrade recall |
| `LCM_MODEL_THRESHOLDS` | empty | Per-model threshold overrides. Format: `"glm-5.2:0.70,glm-5.2-1M:0.25"`. Keys matched as substrings (longest wins). Also settable as `lcm.model_thresholds` in config.yaml. |
| `LCM_FRESH_TAIL_COUNT` | `32` | Recent messages protected from compaction |
| `LCM_FRESH_TAIL_MAX_TOKENS` | `0` | Optional token cap for the protected fresh tail (`0` disables it); always retains the newest message and complete assistant/tool-result groups |
| `LCM_FRESH_TAIL_PRESSURE_YIELD_ENABLED` | `true` | Default-on: when compaction is deadlocked because the count-protected tail covers the whole over-threshold session (#441), the tail yields to a derived token bound so compaction can progress; `false` restores the strict count tail (rollback switch) |
| `LCM_FRESH_TAIL_PRESSURE_YIELD_MIN_OBSERVATIONS` | `3` | Consecutive tail-blocked compaction attempts under host-observed pressure before the yield engages; any attempt not blocked by the tail resets the count; `1` yields on first observation |
| `LCM_INCREMENTAL_MAX_DEPTH` | `3` | Max DAG condensation depth (`-1` = unlimited, `0` = leaf only); enables hierarchical summarization |
| `LCM_LEAF_CHUNK_TOKENS` | `20000` | Raw-backlog floor before leaf compaction; with dynamic chunking enabled, the base chunk target |
| `LCM_LEAF_TARGET_RATIO` | `0.20` | Leaf summary target as a share of the leaf's source tokens (`> 0` and `<= 1`); target = `min(MAX, max(MIN, int(source_tokens * RATIO)))` and the first summary call gets `max_tokens` = 2 × target (#614) |
| `LCM_LEAF_TARGET_MIN_TOKENS` | `2000` | Floor of the leaf summary target (`>= 1`) |
| `LCM_LEAF_TARGET_MAX_TOKENS` | `12000` | Cap of the leaf summary target (`>=` the floor); an out-of-range value of any of the three keys falls back to its default with a config warning |
| `LCM_DYNAMIC_LEAF_CHUNK_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable chunk-sized leaf compaction passes instead of compacting the whole non-tail raw backlog per pass |
| `LCM_DYNAMIC_LEAF_CHUNK_MAX` | `40000` | Upper bound for dynamic leaf chunk targets |
| `LCM_THRESHOLD_FULL_SWEEP_ENABLED` | `false` | At threshold, opt into one synchronous bounded sweep that drains chunked raw history before publishing one new active context |
| `LCM_SUMMARY_PREFIX_TARGET_TOKENS` | `0` | Sweep-only summary-frontier target; `0` derives one `LCM_LEAF_CHUNK_TOKENS` budget |
| `LCM_FOREGROUND_SOFT_SECONDS` | `60` | Sweep soft target, counted from `compress()` entry: after the first stored leaf or condensed node, no summariser call starts unless its recent duration says it ends by then (`0` = none; at most the hard bound) |
| `LCM_FOREGROUND_HARD_SECONDS` | `120` | Sweep hard bound, counted from `compress()` entry: no summariser call starts unless it is expected to end, with a finalize reserve, by then, and none gets a timeout past it (`0` or invalid = `120`) |
| `LCM_NEW_SESSION_RETAIN_DEPTH` | `2` | DAG depth retained after manual `/new` (`-1` all, `0` none) |
| `LCM_DATABASE_PATH` | auto | SQLite database path. Empty config resolves to `HERMES_HOME/lcm.db`; plugin installs or operators may set this env var to another profile-scoped path such as `~/.hermes/hermes-lcm.db`. |
| `LCM_FTS_INTEGRITY_CHECK_INTERVAL_HOURS` | `24` | Minimum hours between startup FTS5 deep integrity-checks (O(index size)). `0` checks every startup; a negative value never checks on startup. Structural checks always run regardless. |
| `LCM_ENABLE_SLASH_COMMAND` | `false` | Enable the optional `/lcm` operator command surface |

When `LCM_FRESH_TAIL_MAX_TOKENS` is enabled, the protected suffix must satisfy
both the message-count and token bounds. The newest message is never dropped,
and a boundary that would begin inside an assistant tool-call/result group is
moved back to that assistant even when doing so exceeds a configured bound.

### Filtering and storage settings

| Variable | Default | Use |
|----------|---------|-----|

| `LCM_SENSITIVE_PATTERNS_ENABLED` | `false` | Opt in to durable deterministic redaction before LCM storage, FTS indexing, summarization, active replay, and externalized ingest payloads; it does not control cloud embedding privacy |
| `LCM_EMBEDDING_PRIVACY_ENABLED` | unset (`auto`) | Protect provider-bound copies for known cloud embedding providers without rewriting durable data. Set `false` for an explicit raw-cloud opt-out (`privacy:off` vector revision); local providers remain unchanged |

| `LCM_LARGE_OUTPUT_EXTERNALIZATION_ENABLED` | `false` | Store oversized ingest payloads, including tool results, media blocks, and generic raw content, in plugin-managed JSON files |
| `LCM_LARGE_OUTPUT_EXTERNALIZATION_THRESHOLD_CHARS` | `12000` | Externalization threshold for normalized payload text |
| `LCM_LARGE_OUTPUT_ACTIVE_REPLAY_STUBBING_ENABLED` | `false` | Replace token-heavy textual tool results with recoverable externalized refs in active replay; current-turn ingest is immediate and historical assembly respects the protected fresh tail; requires large-output externalization |
| `LCM_LARGE_OUTPUT_ACTIVE_REPLAY_STUB_THRESHOLD_TOKENS` | `10000` | First-sight threshold: a new tool result over this many tokens is stubbed at ingest |
| `LCM_LARGE_OUTPUT_ACTIVE_REPLAY_STUB_AGED_THRESHOLD_TOKENS` | `2000` | Aged tier: at a compaction, a tool result outside the fresh tail is stubbed from this many tokens (`0` = the first-sight threshold; never above it) |
| `LCM_LARGE_OUTPUT_TRANSCRIPT_GC_ENABLED` | `false` | Rewrite already-externalized summarized tool rows to compact placeholders |
| `LCM_DOCTOR_CLEAN_APPLY_ENABLED` | `false` | Permit destructive `/lcm doctor clean apply` in trusted operator contexts |
| `LCM_EMPTY_LIFECYCLE_GC_ENABLED` | `true` | Master toggle for automatic pruning of lifecycle rows for sessions that never ingested any messages or summary nodes |
| `LCM_EMPTY_LIFECYCLE_GC_THRESHOLD` | `200` | Number of lifecycle rows at which the GC pass fires |
| `LCM_EMPTY_LIFECYCLE_GC_MAX_AGE_HOURS` | `24` | Automatic GC only deletes empty lifecycle rows at least this old; set `0` only in trusted/test environments that intentionally want immediate empty-row pruning |
| `LCM_DISABLED_TOOLS` | empty | Comma-separated `lcm_*` tool names excluded from injected tool schemas, refused in `handle_tool_call` before message ingest, and filtered from plugin-registry registration — disabled tools cost zero tokens per turn. Unset to restore all tools. |

### Model and timeout settings

| Variable | Default | Use |
|----------|---------|-----|
| `LCM_SUMMARY_MODEL` | auxiliary | Override summarization model |
| `LCM_SUMMARY_REASONING_EFFORT` | task/provider default | Summary reasoning override: `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `xhigh`; YAML key: `lcm.summary_reasoning_effort`. An unsupported value is ignored (falling back to this default) and reported by `/lcm status` and `/lcm doctor` |
| `LCM_SUMMARY_FALLBACK_MODELS` | empty | Comma-separated summarization models tried after `LCM_SUMMARY_MODEL` or the auxiliary task default fails |
| `LCM_SUMMARY_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` | `2` | Consecutive failed summarization calls before a route is skipped temporarily |
| `LCM_SUMMARY_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | `300` | Seconds to skip an open summary route before retrying it |
| `LCM_SUMMARY_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_REJECTION_THRESHOLD` | `6` | Consecutive rejected summary results (no usable text, or not shorter than the source) before a route is skipped temporarily |
| `LCM_EXPANSION_MODEL` | summary model / auxiliary | Override `lcm_expand_query` synthesis model |
| `LCM_EXPANSION_REASONING_EFFORT` | task/provider default | Expansion synthesis reasoning override with the same supported values and the same ignore-and-report handling; YAML key: `lcm.expansion_reasoning_effort` |
| `LCM_EXPANSION_CONTEXT_TOKENS` | `32000` | Context budget used by the auxiliary LLM for `lcm_expand_query` |
| `LCM_SUMMARY_TIMEOUT_MS` | `60000` | Timeout for one summarization call |
| `LCM_SUMMARY_PROMPT_VERSION` | `1` | 1 = today's prompts; 2 = the frontier prompt with the focus directives in the policy and a 3× output ceiling |
| `LCM_NATIVE_RECOVERY` | `false` | Opt-in recovery mode: ingest sources normally, then generate a native active-context summary for the Hermes host's archive transaction, without attempting LCM publication. Retains LCM sources/recall and does not advance its frontier. Keeps sanitized user text in active replay even when its durable copy is externalized, so native summarization can read it; already-published references are not automatically expanded. Requires the host cancellation fence; failure retains context without trimming. |
| `LCM_SURVIVAL_FIT` | `true` | When compaction cannot bring the returned list under the model window (a publication failure, a sweep deadline, a lock), drop the oldest whole user turns from live context until it fits; an oversized newest turn gets a bounded projection. Nothing is deleted: the rows stay stored and reachable with `lcm_grep` / `lcm_load_session`. Logs `LCM survival fit applied`, warns the user once, and `/lcm doctor` reports `survival_fit` |
| `LCM_SURVIVAL_RESERVE` | `0.15` | Share of the model window the survival fit keeps free for the response and host overhead (the fit target is window x (1 - reserve), minus the observed host overhead) |
| `LCM_EXPANSION_TIMEOUT_MS` | `120000` | Timeout for one `lcm_expand_query` synthesis call |
| `LCM_CRITICAL_BUDGET_PRESSURE_RATIO` | `0.0` | Disabled at `0.0`; when set, permits critical-pressure bypasses for bounded deferred catch-up and cache-friendly follow-on condensation only |

Advanced compaction, assembly, and extraction knobs are defined in `config.py`.

### Sensitive-pattern redaction

LCM is lossless by default: durable messages, FTS rows, summaries, and payloads
remain untouched unless `LCM_SENSITIVE_PATTERNS_ENABLED=true` is explicitly set.
Cloud embedding privacy is separate and transforms provider-bound copies only;
it defaults on for known cloud providers and can be explicitly opted out with
`LCM_EMBEDDING_PRIVACY_ENABLED=false`, which uses the `privacy:off` vector
revision and sends raw provider input. The nonempty known-pattern policy
requirements for warmup, backfill, and semantic-query dispatch apply only when
provider-copy privacy is ON — the explicit `privacy:off` opt-out bypasses
catalog validation by design. Local providers receive byte-identical
input and do not enter the cloud privacy path.

When `LCM_SENSITIVE_PATTERNS_ENABLED=true`, matched
secret values are replaced with metadata-only placeholders before SQLite, FTS,
summaries, active replay, and externalized payload JSON receive the content. This
is intentionally not lossless for matching values: the raw matched secret is
unrecoverable after redaction.

Supported named catalog entries are:

- `api_key`: `api_key`, `api_token`, `access_token`, `secret_key`, and
  `client_secret` assignments or JSON keys.
- `bearer_token`: `Bearer ...` strings and token-like JSON keys.
- `password_assignment`: `password`, `passwd`, `pwd`, and `passphrase`
  assignments or JSON keys, including quoted values with spaces.
- `private_key`: PEM private-key blocks.

Redaction is forward-only. Enabling it does not rewrite existing SQLite rows,
FTS shadow tables, DAG summaries, or externalized payload JSON that were written
before the setting was enabled. Non-password placeholders include a short
truncated SHA-256 digest for correlation. `password_assignment` placeholders omit
the digest to avoid making password-like values easier to dictionary-check.
`lcm_status`, `lcm_inspect`, and `lcm_doctor` expose the enabled state, configured pattern names,
unknown names, source, and placeholder format without exposing raw secret values.

Cloud embeddings add a separate provider-input-only privacy transform. It does
not rewrite historical SQLite, FTS, summary, or payload data. It resolves ON
automatically for known cloud providers and does not require
`LCM_SENSITIVE_PATTERNS_ENABLED`. While it is on, cloud warmup, summary/chunk
backfill, and semantic-query dispatch require a nonempty, known
`LCM_SENSITIVE_PATTERNS` catalog; matching provider input becomes pattern-only
placeholders, residual matches are rejected, and the transform version plus
active-pattern-name hash bind into the vector profile revision.
`LCM_EMBEDDING_PRIVACY_ENABLED=false` opts out explicitly and binds the
distinguished `privacy:off` revision instead of blocking. Either way a posture or
policy change refuses dispatch until `/lcm embed warmup` registers the new identity.
FastEmbed is in-process. The shipped Ollama provider does not apply the cloud
gate, so use it only with a trusted local/loopback endpoint; #337 tracks
endpoint-aware locality for remote Ollama configurations.

### Threshold ownership

When `context.engine: lcm-x` is active, `LCM_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD` is the compaction
threshold LCM uses. Hermes core `compression.threshold` belongs to the built-in
compressor. Hermes core `compression.enabled` is still the global gate that
allows compaction, so leave it enabled when using LCM.

If `LCM_ABSOLUTE_THRESHOLD_TOKENS` is set to a positive integer, it overrides the
ratio-derived trigger after window math runs. Use this when you want a fixed
context-health setpoint across model switches (for example `130000` for coding
agents) so a larger window does not silently delay compaction, lower recall, or
let long sessions accumulate more noise before LCM intervenes. Leave it at `0`
to keep ratio-based behavior. When the absolute override is active, Codex
GPT-5.5 ratio auto-raise is suppressed so the absolute setpoint stays pinned.

A single fraction scales the trigger with each route's window. That is fine when
you want each route to use the same share of its window, but on a profile that
switches between windows of very different sizes it can put the trigger much
later than you want. With `LCM_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD=0.75`, a 200k primary route
triggers at 150k tokens, but a backup route that resolves to a 1,000,000-token
window triggers at 750k, so compaction does not run there until a prompt reaches
750k tokens. If you want a smaller prompt budget on that route, either give it
its own fraction (`LCM_MODEL_THRESHOLDS="glm-5.3:0.115"` gives about 115k on a
1M window and leaves every other route unchanged), or pin one trigger for every
route with `LCM_ABSOLUTE_THRESHOLD_TOKENS`. The pin also applies to routes with
a smaller window, so keep it below the smallest window you use. `/lcm status`
reports the resolved `context_length`, `threshold_tokens` and
`context_threshold_source` for the active route.


If startup/status output shows a host-side compression percentage that disagrees
with LCM, trust live LCM status after a normal message has initialized the
session.

For the 2026-08-31 gpt-5.4 Codex-auth retirement, migrate to `gpt-5.6-sol`
(quality) or `gpt-5.6-luna` (cost); `codex_gpt_long_context` remains correct for
their 272K effective window.

### Tuning for large context windows

Long-context models change the tuning problem. A 1M-token model does not mean
you always want to spend 750k prompt tokens before LCM starts compacting. Start
with the active prompt budget you are willing to pay for, then tune the threshold
around that budget. If the budget itself should stay fixed across models, set
`LCM_ABSOLUTE_THRESHOLD_TOKENS` instead of recomputing a ratio per window.

```text
compaction trigger = effective context window * LCM_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD
LCM_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD = desired compaction trigger / effective context window
# or, model-independent:
# LCM_ABSOLUTE_THRESHOLD_TOKENS = desired compaction trigger
```

Examples, as math rather than universal recommendations:

| Effective context window | Desired trigger | Threshold |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| `128000` | `96000` | `0.75` |
| `200000` | `140000` | `0.70` |
| `400000` | `240000` | `0.60` |
| `1000000` | `250000` | `0.25` |
| `1000000` | `400000` | `0.40` |
| `1000000` | `600000` | `0.60` |

A reasonable first pass for a true 1M effective window is:

| Goal | Desired trigger | Threshold | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| Lower spend / earlier DAG building | `200000` to `300000` | `0.20` to `0.30` | Good when cost and latency matter more than maximum live context |
| Balanced large-context use | `350000` to `500000` | `0.35` to `0.50` | Good starting point for many long-running agents |
| Keep more raw context active | `600000+` | `0.60+` | Higher token burn, later compaction |

Tune against your effective `context_length` if Hermes caps the provider's
advertised window.

Start with `LCM_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD`, `LCM_FRESH_TAIL_COUNT`, and large output
externalization. Only tune leaf chunking after checking `lcm_status` and
understanding whether your workload is dominated by huge raw backlog passes.

`LCM_THRESHOLD_FULL_SWEEP_ENABLED=true` is an opt-in cache-shape policy. Once
threshold pressure triggers compaction, the invocation keeps summarizing the
oldest raw chunks outside the protected fresh tail even after pressure falls
below the trigger. It then condenses the provider-visible summary frontier only
when that frontier exceeds `LCM_SUMMARY_PREFIX_TARGET_TOKENS` (or one leaf
budget when the target is `0`). One invocation is bounded to 12 total leaf plus
condensation calls and 120 seconds between calls, persists each completed DAG
pass, and publishes one newly assembled active context at the end. It is
synchronous and independent of deferred/background maintenance.

### Cache policy boundary

LCM is **cache-friendly**, not fully cache-aware. It may avoid some follow-on
condensation churn, but current cache usage counters are retrospective status
data only; they do not tell the plugin whether the next prompt mutation will
break a hot provider cache.

`LCM_CRITICAL_BUDGET_PRESSURE_RATIO` is a narrow escape hatch. It is disabled by
default (`0.0`). When set, LCM compares prompt pressure against the context
window and only at or above that ratio may bypass existing polite gates for
bounded deferred maintenance catch-up and cache-friendly follow-on condensation.
Revisit full cache-aware deferred compaction only after Hermes core exposes
reliable cache state / cache-break signals.

### Session pattern syntax

Pattern matching checks multiple keys: raw `session_id`, `platform`, and
`platform:session_id`.

- `*` matches within one colon-delimited segment
- `**` can span across colons

Example: `cron:*` can match Hermes cron sessions, while exact raw session IDs
still work.

### Noise suppression

LCM offers two layers of noise filtering:

- **Session-level filters** (`LCM_IGNORE_SESSION_PATTERNS`,
  `LCM_STATELESS_SESSION_PATTERNS`) catch noisy traffic that arrives as its own
  session or platform.
- **Message-level patterns** (`LCM_IGNORE_MESSAGE_PATTERNS`) catch cron alerts or
  other noise injected into a normal Telegram or WhatsApp conversation as
  ordinary visible messages.

Message-level patterns are comma-separated Python regex strings compiled once at
engine start. They run against plain text first; structured multimodal payloads
use concatenated text parts first, then normalized JSON fallback when there are
no text parts. Matching messages are skipped before storage.

Example operator config:

```bash
LCM_IGNORE_MESSAGE_PATTERNS=^Cronjob Response:,^>>>Cronjob Response<<<:
```

Invalid regex entries are logged at warning level and dropped. Pattern matching
uses a 50 ms per-pattern timeout when the optional `regex` package is installed.
If `regex` is not installed, LCM logs a warning and disables message-level regex
filtering rather than running unbounded stdlib `re` matches in the ingest path.

Known limitation: the filter runs at ingest time. When a matching message is part
of the chunk summarized in the same turn it arrived, the text may appear inside
the resulting summary node. The filtered message is still not written to the
message store, so DAG lineage stays clean; only serialized summary text can carry
it.

`lcm_status` surfaces the full filter contract under `session_filters`, including
pattern sources, whether the current session is ignored/stateless, and a
process-lifetime `ignored_message_count`.

Ignored/stateless sessions are a storage ownership boundary, not a context-window
opt-out. LCM does not ingest raw messages or create DAG nodes for sessions that
match `LCM_IGNORE_SESSION_PATTERNS`, `LCM_STATELESS_SESSION_PATTERNS`, or the
in-process auxiliary/thread stateless marker. If those sessions cross the normal
context threshold, LCM delegates the compaction call to Hermes' native
`ContextCompressor` so the active request is still bounded before model overflow.
If the native compressor is unavailable, LCM falls back to a deterministic
head/tail trim as a last-resort safety net, still without writing the bypassed
session to `lcm.db`.

### Large tool-output handling

Storage-boundary payload guard contract: LCM prevents media-ish inline payloads from being written into plugin-local SQLite rows at the storage boundary.

Externalization for ordinary large tool output is opt-in. When enabled,
oversized tool results are written to plugin-managed JSON files and referenced
from summaries. They remain inspectable through
`lcm_describe(externalized_ref=...)` and `lcm_expand(externalized_ref=...)`.

Active-replay stubbing is a second, independently opt-in replay policy. When
both externalization and active-replay stubbing are enabled, newly ingested
textual tool results above the first-sight token threshold (10,000) are durably externalized and
replaced immediately in provider-visible replay, including results in the
protected fresh tail. This lets a stub-only replay change converge even when no
leaf is eligible for compaction. At a compaction, a historical assembly pass
stubs older tool results from the aged threshold (2,000 tokens) before budgeting,
while respecting the protected fresh tail. Tool-call ids and compatible structured text block types/keys are
retained; raw SQLite rows and DAG lineage are not rewritten by the historical
pass. Structured image/media results remain inline, preserving the provider
replay contract established by upstream Hermes-LCM PR #226. If durable externalization
cannot be confirmed, replay keeps the original payload inline. Results from
`lcm_describe` and `lcm_expand` also remain inline so recovery does not
recursively produce another ref.

An automatic compaction whose input reached the threshold first tries these free
cuts (#671): it assembles the summary prefix, the externalized placeholders and the
aged-tier stubs without a model call and, when the host-measured list is at or under
min(threshold - `LCM_LEAF_CHUNK_TOKENS`, 0.95 x threshold), returns it with no leaf,
no condensation and no summariser call. The rows no leaf summarised stay stored and
are recorded as raw backlog; the stop reason `stub_first_exit` is a partial stop in
`lcm_status` (`last_stub_first_exit`, and the threshold sweep record when the sweep is
on), the doctor and the `LCM compaction stop:` line, with the tokens before and after,
the target and the backlog rows left. Recovery attempts, forced overflow and calls
below the threshold never take this exit; when the cuts miss the target the
compaction runs as before.

The storage-boundary payload guard is separate from that opt-in. LCM always
scans messages at the store boundary before writing `messages.content` or
`messages.tool_calls` to SQLite. Inline `data:*;base64,...` payloads and
conservative long base64-looking runs are replaced with compact placeholders and
written to the same plugin-managed externalized-payload directory.

This avoids duplicating media-ish payload bytes into `lcm.db`, FTS shadow tables,
WAL files, or ordinary SQLite backups while preserving lossless recovery via the
placeholder `ref` and `lcm_expand(externalized_ref=...)`. If externalization
fails, LCM logs a warning and leaves the original text inline rather than
dropping data.

`lcm_doctor` reports SQLite `journal_mode`, `quick_check`, database/WAL sizes,
largest content/tool-call rows, suspicious inline payload rows, and aggregate
externalized-payload stats. Doctor output is metadata-only for these scans.

This guard is scoped to LCM's own `lcm.db` write boundary. It does not prevent
Hermes core, or any other host layer, from writing inline payloads to Hermes
`state.db`, and it does not rewrite historical rows already present in `lcm.db`.
If bytes already landed in Hermes `state.db`, that is upstream/outside LCM scope;
use backup-first cleanup or migration procedures before mutating historical host
rows.

Transcript GC is separate and opt-in. It only rewrites already-externalized,
already-summarized tool-role rows to compact placeholders. It keeps the same
`store_id`, keeps payload files, skips pinned messages, and preserves lossless
recovery through `externalized_ref`.

## Retrieval contract

LCM retrieval tools default to current-session scope. `lcm_grep` accepts
`session_scope='all'` or `session_scope='session'` as an explicit opt-in for
bounded archive search over rows already present in `lcm.db` (raw-message hits
only). Once a session id is known, `lcm_load_session` can enumerate that
session's raw transcript in chronological `store_id` pages without a search
query. Use Hermes `session_search` for broad cross-session history outside the
LCM database.

Within the current session, `source` filters raw rows directly and filters
summary nodes by descendant raw-message source lineage. `unknown` is a real
source value, not a wildcard. Legacy blank-source rows are treated as `unknown`.
`role`, `time_from`, and `time_to` are raw-message filters applied in the message
search query before result limiting. When a raw-message filter is active,
`lcm_grep` returns raw rows only and reports `summary_results_omitted`.

Tool responses are bounded so one retrieval call cannot flood the main context.

### Lossless raw recovery contract

Lossless recovery means raw content is stored with stable source lineage and can
be recovered in deterministic pages:

- `lcm_expand(node_id=...)` pages immediate sources with `source_offset` and
  `source_limit`
- `lcm_load_session(session_id=...)` pages ordered raw session rows with
  `after_store_id` and `next_cursor`
- oversized raw messages continue with `content_offset`
- `lcm_expand(externalized_ref=...)` pages payload content with `content_offset`
- `lcm_expand_query` uses `context_max_tokens` for auxiliary context and reports
  truncation/pagination hints when needed

Carried-over summary nodes can become current-session content after `/new`, but
their source eligibility still comes from descendant raw messages. Expanding a
carried-over current-session node recovers the original raw message sources even
when those sources still belong to a previous session.

## OpenClaw/lossless-claw import

LCM-X includes an opt-in operator script for backfilling OpenClaw history into
the local LCM-X SQLite store. It supports two source shapes:

1. **SQLite LCM database** (`--source-db`) for migrations from an existing
   lossless-claw/OpenClaw `lcm.db`.
2. **JSONL session exports** (`--source-jsonl` / `--source-jsonl-dir`) for fresh
   installs, plugin-off catch-up, or migrations where no source SQLite database
   is available.

SQLite source example:

```bash
python scripts/import_lossless_claw.py \
  --source-db ~/.openclaw/path/to/lcm.db \
  --target-db ~/.hermes/lcm.db \
  --agent sammy
```

JSONL source example:

```bash
python scripts/import_lossless_claw.py \
  --source-jsonl ~/.openclaw/agents/sammy/sessions/session-a.jsonl \
  --target-db ~/.hermes/lcm.db \
  --agent sammy \
  --json
```

For a directory of session exports:

```bash
python scripts/import_lossless_claw.py \
  --source-jsonl-dir ~/.openclaw/agents/sammy/sessions \
  --target-db ~/.hermes/lcm.db \
  --agent sammy
```

The script is intentionally conservative:

- dry-run is the default; pass `--apply` to write
- run it against an explicit target DB path, preferably while Hermes is stopped
  for that profile
- writes create a timestamped target DB backup first when the target already
  exists
- SQLite imports can include OpenClaw summaries with `--include-summaries`; this
  migrates compatible summary rows into Hermes `summary_nodes`
- JSONL imports migrate raw message rows only; JSONL does not carry a summary DAG
- imported rows keep explicit provenance in `session_id` and `source`, for
  example `openclaw-lcm:agent:sammy:<source-session>` or
  `openclaw-jsonl:agent:sammy:<source-session>`
- the SQLite default provenance identity is the source `conversations.session_id`,
  preserving source session boundaries even when many conversations share one
  `session_key`
- pass `--session-identity session_key` only for SQLite imports when you
  intentionally want conversations with the same source session key grouped into
  one imported LCM session
- reruns are idempotent for the same `--import-id`; the default `import_id` is
  source-path-derived, so pass a stable `--import-id` if you may import the same
  copied DB or JSONL export set from different paths
- `--json` prints a reconciliation report with `scanned`, `eligible`,
  `would_import`, `imported`, `skipped_existing`, `skipped_empty`,
  `invalid_rows`, `warnings`, and summary counters
- changing `--agent`, `--namespace`, or `--session-identity` under the same
  `--import-id` is treated as the same import and will skip already-tracked
  source messages; use a new `--import-id` for a different mapping
- no OpenClaw config or separate secret tables are imported, but raw transcripts,
  summaries, and tool payloads may contain sensitive user data

This is a local archive migration path. It does not make LCM a general memory
provider, and it does not change the current-session retrieval contract for
agent tools.

For databases that already contain large historical tool rows,
`scripts/backfill_externalized_tool_outputs.py` can pre-create native recovery
sidecars without rewriting SQLite. It is dry-run by default, writes a scrubbed
digest/count manifest, is idempotent on repeat apply, and supports guarded
manifest-based rollback. See the [operator guide](docs/operator-guide.md#historical-tool-output-sidecars).

## Troubleshooting

### `hermes plugins` shows `lcm-x (not found)` but LCM tools exist

If `plugins.enabled` contains `hermes-lcm-x`, `context.engine: lcm-x` is set, and
the runtime exposes LCM tools, LCM is loaded. The `lcm-x (not found)` line is a
Hermes host discovery/status mismatch, not an LCM storage or compaction failure.

### `/lcm status` looks unbound after restart

Compatible Hermes gateway hosts expose task-local lane metadata while
dispatching `/lcm`. Once that lane has constructed an agent, `/lcm status`
resolves the same active LCM runtime as `lcm_status`, including its foreground
view while an ignored or stateless side channel is bound. Before the first
normal message constructs an agent, or in a genuinely sessionless process,
`session_id: (unbound)` and `threshold_tokens: (uninitialized)` remain expected.

## Architecture

The engine sits between Hermes context assembly and the backing conversation
store. It records raw messages, compacts old material into a summary DAG, and
exposes retrieval tools that can drill back into exact stored sources.

## How it works

1. **Ingest** - persist each message in SQLite with FTS metadata
2. **Compact** - summarize older messages outside the fresh tail into D0 leaf
   nodes
3. **Condense** - merge same-depth nodes into higher-depth summaries
4. **Escalate** - shrink oversize summaries from detailed to bullets to
   deterministic truncate
5. **Assemble** - combine system prompt, highest-depth summaries, and fresh tail
6. **Retrieve** - use LCM tools to drill into compacted history or synthesize
   from expanded context
